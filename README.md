# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML

Machine Learning Project for Udacity's Machine Learning Cross-Skilling Program


# Project Brief

This repo containsmy work for the Project of Udacity's Machine Learning Cross-Skilling Program. In this project I applied supervised ML techniques on census data to help Charity ML identify people with a very high possiablity to donate for Charity ML. I did multipule transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. Then I evaluated 3 supervised ML models of my choice on the data based on based on accuracy, F-score metrics, & algorithm efficiency. Then I tuned and optimized the selected model.
