Investigated the factors affecting the possibility of a donation being made using real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results. Trained and tested multiple supervised ML models on census data to predict a donation possibility. The model was selected based on accuracy, F-score metrics, &amp; algorithm efficiency.
